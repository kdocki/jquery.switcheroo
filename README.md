# jquery.toggler

What is it? What is it good for? *huggh* absolutely nothing.

## todos

use addClass and removeClass instead of switchOn and switchOff handlers.

Add classNames instead of className to defaults. 

```
  classNames: ['', 'active'],
```

toggles between no class and active but you could add as many as you wanted to this array and it just steps through incrementally.
